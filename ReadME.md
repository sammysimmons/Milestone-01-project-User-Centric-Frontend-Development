Project 01 - User Centrics Frontend Development - Code Institute

Being a graphic designer for the past 10 years, and recently transitioning into UX design, i have built myself a portfolio of project, with my skills i have accuired over the years. I wanted to utilise these beautiful projects, and push them into a portfolio based website, for potential freelance opportunities and future employees, including an introductory to myself, along with my skillset as these can contribute to my coding career. I have also ensure access to platforms in which my work can be accessed, along with a CV with further information.

# UX
Designed for future employees to showcase skills and examples of work, but also on an advertisement bases for freelance opportunites.

## *User Stories -*

As an Employer I expect to see recent projects of samanthas work, along with a downloadable link for her CV.

As a customer I also expect to see recent projects Samantha has worked on but also be able to get in touch to discuss work availability.

# Features
I have utilised alot of my project work to create the background of this project, along with creating my own brand identity, and follow the colour scheme throughout the website.

## Features left to implement
1)I would like to implement a hover over section, which would give an overview into each project, giving a description and a title.

2) I would like to built a portfolio page which would contain a full in depth portfolio, along with more descriptions

3) I would like to continue to expand on the blog page, and write up my journey from graphic designer, to developer.

4) Including more animation into the curcular percentage bars for my skill overview.

5) include a service section in which i can explain and sell my skills even further.

# technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 

# Testing
For future Freelance opportunities, the intended outcome was to provide the user with an insight into my design skills and background, but also to showcase my work. The hero for the landing page was built combining projects from this year, that i have worked on, along with combining a photoshopped file of myself climbing, as i also wish to use this website for a blog about my climbing adventures.
The about me section, includes a "download CV" button, for a more indepth background into my employment history, if you look closly my CV is also embedded into the mobile screen which sits in the background.

All links will open in a new tab using the target="_blank" the CV with also open in a new tab. All links used have been manually tested.

My clicking on links in the nav bar, you are taken straight to that area of the landing page, apart from the blog page, which I plan on expanding further into a blog.

When using the Contact Form, I have ensured all fields are required before you can submit an enquiry, this has also been tested manually.

## Errors i came across
When testing my site, the areas that needed re-assessing was the portfolio section where i have tiled out my previous work, as the format for this section changed a few times when designing for mobile. Once key lesson i have learnt now working in UX design, is to always design for mobile first.

Additionally to this, i can across the error 404 failed to load resource when testing in safari, however after i re-uploaded my hero image this error disappeared.

Another error i came across was getting imagery to work on all deviced in particular android, which from some reasearch i found the media styling tags in particular, can be the resport of the problem, when i removed these it resolved this issue.

# Deployment
The site is hosted using github pages, any additional or new commits will automatically be updated as this links to my master branch.
I have done this via working with GitHub Desktop, changing my git repository name to match my username, this then enables me to publish live, through github pages.
